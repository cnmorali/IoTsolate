Network Microsegmentation for Securing and Managing IoT Devices


IoTsolate uses VLAN microsegmentation to identify, isolate, and neutralize security risks in IoT devices, with a user-friendly interface. Our solution divides your network into isolated segments, each with specific and customized security rules. This ensures that if a device is compromised, it cannot impact other devices within the network.
